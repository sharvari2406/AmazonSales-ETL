# Maximizing E-Commerce Revenue: Leveraging Azure ETL for Sales Analysis and Optimization
## Overview
This project focuses on harnessing the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Azure to develop a robust Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline tailored for e-commerce operations. Leveraging Azure Blob Storage as the data source, the pipeline efficiently extracts data and performs necessary transformations using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory. Supporting various data formats like Delta and Parquet, it ensures versatility and efficacy in data management. Moreover, the pipeline incorporates a sales analysis module powered by PySpark within Azure Databricks, facilitating comprehensive examination and interpretation of sales data. The resulting analyzed data is securely stored in a SQL layer for future utilization. By streamlining the data processing workflow, this holistic solution empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in e-commerce settings.

## Dataset
The dataset employed in this project comprises comprehensive data on e-commerce sales transactions within Amazon India. It encompasses a wide array of information, ranging from customer demographics and product categories to order specifics, payment methods, and shipping details. This rich dataset enables thorough examination of sales trends, customer preferences, and profitability metrics within the e-commerce domain, facilitating insightful analysis and informed decision-making.
