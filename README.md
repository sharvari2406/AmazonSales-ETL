# Maximizing E-Commerce Revenue: Leveraging Azure ETL for Sales Analysis and Optimization
## Overview
This project focuses on harnessing the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Azure to develop a robust Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline tailored for e-commerce operations. Leveraging Azure Blob Storage as the data source, the pipeline efficiently extracts data and performs necessary transformations using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory. Supporting various data formats like Delta and Parquet, it ensures versatility and efficacy in data management. Moreover, the pipeline incorporates a sales analysis module powered by PySpark within Azure Databricks, facilitating comprehensive examination and interpretation of sales data. The resulting analyzed data is securely stored in a SQL layer for future utilization. By streamlining the data processing workflow, this holistic solution empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in e-commerce settings.
