# Maximizing E-Commerce Revenue: Leveraging Azure ETL for Sales Analysis and Optimization
## Overview
This project focuses on harnessing the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Azure to develop a robust Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline tailored for e-commerce operations. Leveraging Azure Blob Storage as the data source, the pipeline efficiently extracts data and performs necessary transformations using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory. Supporting various data formats like Delta and Parquet, it ensures versatility and efficacy in data management. Moreover, the pipeline incorporates a sales analysis module powered by PySpark within Azure Databricks, facilitating comprehensive examination and interpretation of sales data. The resulting analyzed data is securely stored in a SQL layer for future utilization. By streamlining the data processing workflow, this holistic solution empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, thereby enhancing decision-making processes in e-commerce settings.

## Dataset
The dataset employed in this project comprises comprehensive data on e-commerce sales transactions within Amazon India. It encompasses a wide array of information, ranging from customer demographics and product categories to order specifics, payment methods, and shipping details. This rich dataset enables thorough examination of sales trends, customer preferences, and profitability metrics within the e-commerce domain, facilitating insightful analysis and informed decision-making.

## Prerequisites
Microsoft Azure Subscription provides a suite of powerful services tailored for efficient data management and analytics:

1. **Azure Blob Storage**: Ideal for storing vast amounts of unstructured data such as images and videos, offering scalable object storage capabilities.

2. **Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage**: Combines the features of Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake, offering a highly scalable solution specifically designed for big data analytics.

3. **Azure Databricks**: An advanced analytics platform based on Apache Spark, facilitating big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative data science projects.

4. **Azure SQL Server**: A fully managed relational database service leveraging the SQL Server engine, ensuring high-performance and reliable data storage and processing.

5. **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database service compatible with the SQL Server engine, providing scalable and secure database solutions for modern applications.

6. **Azure Data Factory**: A comprehensive data integration service enabling the creation, scheduling, and orchestration of ETL and ELT workflows. Featuring a visually intuitive interface, it allows for the seamless movement and transformation of data at scale.

## Data Flow
Data Flow Overview:

1. **Extract Data**: CSV data is fetched from Azure Blob Storage and transferred to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for processing.

2. **Transform Data**: Leveraging PySpark on Azure Databricks, the data undergoes analysis and transformation. The processed results are stored back in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

3. **Load Data**: The transformed data is loaded into an Azure SQL database, establishing a robust reporting layer conducive to dashboard creation.

4. **Automation**: End-to-end pipelines are constructed within Azure Data Factory, automating the entire data flow process from extraction to reporting layers. This ensures seamless and efficient management of the data pipeline.

## Setup and Configuration
Azure Blob Storage:
1. Establish a container within your Azure Blob Storage account.
2. Upload your input data files to the designated container.

Azure Data Lake Storage:
1. Create a file system in your Azure Data Lake Storage account.
2. Configure a directory within the file system to accommodate processed Parquet files.

Azure Databricks:
1. Configure a cluster with the required dependencies and settings for Python and PySpark. For instance, utilize a cluster configured with version 9.1 LTS, incorporating Apache Spark 3.1.2 and Scala 2.12.
2. Generate a new notebook within your Azure Databricks workspace.

Azure SQL Database:
1. Establish a SQL database within the Azure environment.
2. Define the necessary tables within the database to accommodate the processed data.

Azure Data Factory:
1. Develop a new pipeline within your Azure Data Factory instance.
2. Create link services for each Azure functionality utilized, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL.
3. Incorporate activities within the pipeline to execute each stage of the workflow, comprising:
   a. Data copying from Azure Blob Storage to Azure Data Lake Storage.
   b. Data processing within Azure Databricks.
   c. Data transferring from Azure Data Lake Storage to Azure SQL Database.

Executing the Pipeline:
1. Initiate the "Run All Pipelines" pipeline run within Azure Data Factory.
2. Monitor the pipeline run to ensure successful completion of each step.
